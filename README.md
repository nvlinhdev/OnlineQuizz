# Java Web Application with Servlet, JSP, and JDBC

## Overview
This project is a simple **Java Web Application** built using:
- **Java Servlet** for request handling  
- **JSP (JavaServer Pages)** for server-side rendering  
- **JDBC** for database connectivity  

It was developed as part of my practice to strengthen **fundamentals of backend web development** before moving to frameworks like Spring Boot.

## Tech Stack
- **Java SE 8+**  
- **Servlet API & JSP**  
- **JDBC** with MySQL/PostgreSQL  
- **Apache Tomcat** (as servlet container)  
- **Maven** (for dependency management)

---

## Features
- User authentication (login/logout)  
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with database via JDBC  
- MVC pattern (Servlets as Controllers, JSP as View, JDBC as Model layer)  
- Simple session management
